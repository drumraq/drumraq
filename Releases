update (1.5.0) - 25Apr2025
    Drag MIDI from Plugin to DAW for Precise Timing.
        Sequencers in general are designed to work in perfect bars, meaning the sequence must start at the exact beginning of a bar.
        This limitation can make it impossible to start playback from the middle of a bar within the plugin itself.
        Solution - Create midi out of the sequence, drop it into your DAW and place it anywhere on the timeline.

    Preset are now portable. Audio files are part of preset along with patterns and other parameters/setting.
        Means presets now can be transferred to other systems or can be shared with others.

    Improved midi processing.

    Some ui adjustment.
        Themes tab is just a color wheel now. Takes less space.
        Added an 'About' alert window to display a brief description of the plugin. It appears when clicking on the plugin name 'DRUMRAQ'.

    Few internal optimizations.
